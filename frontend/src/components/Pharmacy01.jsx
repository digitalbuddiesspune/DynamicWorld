                To pursue a Pharmacy course, students must have completed Class
                12 in the Science stream, with subjects like Physics, Chemistry,
                and Biology or Mathematics (PCMB/PCM). Studying Pharmacy
                (D.Pharm | B.Pharm | M.Pharm) offers a wide range of academic,
                professional, and personal benefits. It provides students with a
                strong foundation in science—combining chemistry, biology, and
                medicine—to understand how drugs are developed, tested, and used
                to treat diseases. Pharmacy graduates enjoy diverse career
                opportunities across healthcare, research, the pharmaceutical
                industry, and regulatory bodies.
