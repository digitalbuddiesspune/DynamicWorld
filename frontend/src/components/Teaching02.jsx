              If you’re passionate about teaching, you can pursue various
              courses to become an educator. The Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.)
              is the most common undergraduate course for aspiring teachers. For
              those interested in physical education, the Bachelor of Physical
              Education (BP.Ed) is the ideal choice. After completing a B.Ed.,
              you can further your expertise with a Master in Education (M.Ed.).
